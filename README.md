## **Code Structure**

The app follows **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) Architecture** with a clean and modular approach:

- **Model**: Defines data entities and manages database interactions.
- **View**: Composed of Activities/Fragments (or Jetpack Compose components) to render UI.
- **ViewModel**: Handles UI-related logic and manages data using LiveData/Flow.
- **Repository**: Mediator between ViewModel and data sources (API, Firebase, Room).
- **Use Cases**: Encapsulates business logic for modularity.

This structure ensures scalability, testability, and ease of maintenance.
